          <h2>What is Afrobeats?</h2>
          <p>
            Afrobeat is a music genre that fuses African music with Black
            American influences to produce a compelling hybrid of culture and
            sound. The genre is largely the creation of Nigerian artist Fela
            Kuti who, with his band Africa 70, forged a
            <a
              href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/funk-music-guide"
              target="_blank"
              >rythm</a
            >
            mix of West African beats (predominantly Nigerian and Ghanaian) and
            American jazz,
            <a
              href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/soul-music-guide"
              target="_blank"
              >soul</a
            >, and
            <a
              href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/funk-music-guide"
              target="_blank"
              >funk</a
            >, which was shot through with a potent streak of political
            awareness. Kuti’s music lit the fuse for Afrobeat, and the torch was
            carried forward by a mix of African artists, like Kuti’s former
            drummer, Tony Allen. In the West, performers Brian Eno and David
            Byrne from The Talking Heads drew on Afrobeat for their
            groundbreaking album Remain in Light (1980). Listeners can still
            hear Kuti’s influence in the music of his sons, Femi Kuti and Seun
            Kuti, and modern Western bands like the Grammy-winning Antibalas.
            Afrobeat music is frequently labeled as Afrobeats, an umbrella term
            for a far-ranging music scene from West Africa and the United
            Kingdom, which incorporates many popular music styles. The two
            sounds share only a common heritage.

          <h2>History of Afrobeats</h2>
          <p>
            The history of Afrobeat began in the early twentieth century when
            musicians from Ghana combined West African regional music with
            Western jazz and
            <a
              href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/calypso-music-guide"
              target="_blank"
              >calypso</a
            >. The resulting new sound became known as highlife, which continued
            to fold additional Western influences into its heady mix over the
            next few decades.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Kuti and Africa 70 carve out the sound: Nigerian musician Fela
              Aníkúlápó-Kuti, who began his career playing in an array of
              African highlife and jazz bands, absorbed the sounds of soul,
              jazz,
              <a
                href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/soca-music-guide"
                target="_blank"
                >soca</a
              >
              and rhythm and blues during various tours of America and the
              United Kingdom. He then unleashed this formidable creation in his
              band, Nigeria 70 (later Africa 70), debuting his unique new
              musical style in the early 1970s.
            </li>
            <li>
              Development of the core sound and politics: With their debut
              album, Zombie, Kuti and Africa 70 established the core sound of
              Afrobeat, which freely mixed jazz and highlife with the epic funk
              of James Brown,
              <a
                href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/reggae-music-guide"
                target="_blank"
                >reggae</a
              >
              and Caribbean rhythm, and psychedelic rock. Kuti sang over tracks
              in English and Yoruba, leading the band on saxophone, keyboards,
              and other instruments. He also lent Afrobeat a political side by
              criticizing the human rights records of Nigeria and the United
              States on record and in his marathon live performances.
            </li>
            <li>
              Continuation under Egypt 80: Kuti remained a major artist in
              Africa and abroad until his death in 1997; his son Seun renamed
              the band Egypt 80 and continued to record and perform, as did
              Seun’s brother, Femi, who enjoyed a degree of popularity similar
              to that of his father.
            </li>
            <li>
              Afrofunk is born: The most successful figure from Kuti’s orbit was
              undoubtedly drummer Tony Allen, who expanded on the Afrobeat sound
              by mixing in elements of hip-hop, dub, and electronica to form a
              new subgenre called Afrofunk. Allen enjoyed even wider exposure
              than his former bandleader through collaborations with Air, Zap
              Mama, and Damon Albarn of Blur, among others.
            </li>
            <li>
              influence: The work of Fela Kuti and Allen was the bedrock of
              Afrobeat, but jazz musicians like Roy Ayers also recorded
              Afrobeat-inspired music in the 1970s. Ayers toured Nigeria with
              the elder Kuti in the late ’70s. Contemporary artists like
              Antibalas and Zongo Junction—both hailing from Brooklyn, New York—
              have carved careers out of the Afrobeat sound. Mainstream rock and
              soul bands, like TV on the Radio and the Budos Band, have also
              recorded songs with an Afrobeat flavor.
